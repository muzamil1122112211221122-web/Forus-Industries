# Minimal Vercel Configuration - No Function Errors

## Problem Resolved
Removed all properties that cause "function property cannot be used as build property" error.

## Ultra-Simple vercel.json
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

## Manual Vercel Dashboard Settings

Since automatic configuration is causing issues, configure manually in Vercel:

### Project Settings:
1. **Framework Preset**: Other
2. **Build Command**: `npm run build`  
3. **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
4. **Install Command**: `npm install`
5. **Node.js Version**: 18.x

### Environment Variables:
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY_1` = your primary API key
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY_2` = your secondary API key
- `NODE_ENV` = production

## Alternative: Deploy as Static Site Only

If backend functions continue causing issues:

1. **Remove server folder** from deployment
2. **Deploy only client folder**
3. **Use client-side API calls** directly to OpenRouter
4. **Simpler, more reliable deployment**

## Recommendation: Use Railway

For full-stack apps, Railway is much more reliable:
1. Go to railway.app
2. Connect GitHub repository  
3. Automatically handles full-stack deployment
4. No configuration file needed
5. Works with Express.js backend

The minimal vercel.json eliminates all function-related errors.
